Team: GMO

Mission Statement:

Our team will work in close and ongoing communication with our GMO project leader Brian Wong as 
well as our mentor Dr. Bauchuan Lu to create the new system.  We will implement weekly meetings 
with GMO over Google Hangout to go over what we have done, problems we are having, and how to move 
foward. We will also use a weekly status update every Sunday to recap our progress. Our goal is to 
create an easier way to communicate to those who want to know more about Christ.  Since GMO wants 
to reach as many people as possible, we want to help them in their goals to expand opportunities 
for ministry to the internet and to have the ability to reach people from all parts of the world.
